                    <h3>osu!</h3>
                    <br>
                    osu! is a very populair rythm game made by peppy. it started first as an individual project. <br>
                    but since it grew alot it has been grown out to have multiple people work for the project. <br>
                    osu! also has 4 different game modes. there is: standard, mania, catch and taiko. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>osu!standard</h4>
                    <br>
                    osu!standard is one of the populair gamemodes that osu provides. <br>
                    the standard gamemode requires you to click clircles to the beat of the song. <br>
                    what people also call the standard game mode is an aim trainer. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>osu!mania</h4>
                    <br>
                    osu!mania is a gamemode where you press keys to the beat of the song. <br>
                    what is important for mania is your accuracy and the patterns. <br>
                    patterns are a group of notes put into a certain section <br>
                    some of the known patterns are stairs/streams and jacks. <br>
                    stairs/streams are a countinouse section where there are 4 notes in a row with a bit of delay. <br>
                    so you dont hit the 4 notes at once but one to one. those are stairs. <br>
                    streams are the same as stairs but it just goes back and forward. <br>
                    jacks are mainly 2 notes you have to hit together in a countinues moition. <br>                
                    <br>
                    <h4>osu!catch</h4>
                    <br>
                    osu!catch is a gamemode where you have to catch fruits that are falling from the top of the screen. <br>
                    there are some fruits that are red that makes you move very fast. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>osu!taiko</h4>
                    <br>
                    osu!taiko is a clone of the populair game taiko no tatsujin made by bandai namco. <br>
                    in this gamemode you have to hit the keys to the beat of the song. <br>
                    there are 2 different types of notes. youve got a red and blue drum. <br>
                    there are 2 buttons you can press for each drum to alternate. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>osu!lazer</h3>
                    <br>
                    osu!lazer is a gamemode that is still in development. <br>
                    most of the stuff thats in testing and reworks are made in lazer. <br>
                    people can also make custom gamemodes in lazer so has there been alot of copies of populair rythm games. <br>
                    but also there has been some original gamemodes made.
